      <p>
        during Primavera Sound 2022, i took my fujifilm x100s to sunny
        afternoons and starlit nights at Parc del Forum, and took a bunch of
        pictures.

        <br /><br />

        looking at them, later, i wondered about all these people completely
        filling up a place for three days, and then leaving it behind without
        ever glancing back. some would go back to the ancient libraries of the
        university; some might go back to their laptop jobs, in an office, at
        home, or at a Sandwichez; others would board a plane (probably to the
        UK), and continue their lives there. everyone's head would be filled
        with memories of a vibrant, decorated, and jubilant primavera, the
        concrete structures of Parc del Forum only a backdrop to vivid colours
        and sounds.

        <br /><br />

        but what would this concrete park look like without the festival which
        borrows its shapes every year? i wanted to explore this. i went back in
        early february, and took the same pictures i had taken during the
        festival itself.

                  such a difference, no? how many visitors know that there is a
                  harbour there? and the wintery sun shines such a unique light
                  on the Parc, and gives its body a stark, austere look.

                  <br /><br />

                  would it not be amazing for everyone who visits the festival
                  to be able to see how much this environment can change? i want
                  to propose something to you: to print these pictures on large
                  canvases and hang them, side by side, during the upcoming
                  edition of Primavera (in Barcelona). it could be alongside one
                  of the long passages between areas, where you have fencing and
                  decoration, and there is plenty of space.

                  i'm asking you to finance the costs of printing and placement,
                  but i don't need any additional compensation. i would just
                  like to contribute to this wonderful summery festival, and it
                  would be an honour for me to have these pictures on display
                  there (:

        i selected the pictures above because of their striking differences, but
        below is an overview with all the comparisons i shot. for the pictures
        where people are clearly identifiable, i have requested them for
        permission.
